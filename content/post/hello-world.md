Hello.

Just trying to see how well this works.

Oh look, this theme supports code highlights too!

```typescript

  const msg: string = 'Howdy world!';
  console.log(msg);

```

That's pretty awesome, actually. Let's try something newer.

```swift

  for _ in 0..<10 {
      print("I love coding!")
  }

```

Ok. That's super cool.
